carpentry: "swc"

# This option is currently only needed for Data Carpentry workshops.
# The value of the variable will be ignored for Software Carpentry and
# Library Carpentry workshops.
# Possible values are:
# dc-ecology: for Data Carpentry Ecology workshops
# dc-genomics: for Data Carpentry Genomics
# dc-socsci: for Data Carpentry Social Sciences
# dc-geospatial: for Data Carpentry Geospatial
curriculum: "FIXME"

# If there is both an R and python official version of a curriculum, change the
# value of the variable below ("flavor") to get the schedule updated accordingly
# (valid values are 'r' or 'python').
# Note: this is only for Data Carpentry curricula at this time.
flavor: "r"

# Overall title for the Workshop.
# This variable is used to (optionally) add a title in the "jumbotron"
# (the grey box at the top of the page), and to the extra pages.

# pages are included in the README:
# https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template#creating-extra-pages
