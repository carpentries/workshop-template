carpentry: "swc"

# This option is currently only needed for
# Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry workshops.
# The value of the variable will be ignored for Library Carpentry
# workshops.
# Possible values are:
# dc-astronomy:     for Data Carpentry Astronomy
# dc-ecology:       for Data Carpentry Ecology
# dc-genomics:      for Data Carpentry Genomics
# dc-socsci:        for Data Carpentry Social Sciences

curriculum: "FIXME"

# If there is both an R and python official version of a curriculum
# (as listed on https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ and
# https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/), change the
# value of the variable below ("flavor") to get the schedule and installation
# instructions updated accordingly (valid values are 'r' or 'python').
# Note: this is only for Data Carpentry and SWC at this time.
flavor: "FIXME"

# If the workshop will be a lesson pilot (for a new official lesson or
# a lesson in The Carpentries Incubator), set pilot to "true"
pilot: false

# Overall title for the Workshop.
# This variable is used to (optionally) add a title in the "jumbotron"
