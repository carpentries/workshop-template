SCHEDULE

Show the workshop's schedule.

Small changes to the schedule can be made by modifying the
`schedule.html` found in the `_includes` folder for your
workshop type (`swc`, `lc`, or `dc`). Edit the items and
times in the table to match your plans. You may also want to
change 'Day 1' and 'Day 2' to be actual dates or days of the
week.

For larger changes, a blank template for a 4-day workshop
(useful for online teaching for instance) can be found in
`_includes/custom-schedule.html`. Add the times, and what
you will be teaching to this file. You may also want to add
rows to the table if you wish to break down the schedule
further. To use this custom schedule here, replace the block
of code below the Schedule `<h2>` header below with
`{% include custom-schedule.html %}`.

The lesson taught in this workshop is being piloted and a precise schedule is yet to be established. The workshop will include regular breaks. If you would like to know the timing of these breaks in advance, please [contact the workshop organisers](#contact). For a list of lesson sections and estimated timings, [visit the lesson homepage]({{ site.lesson_site }}).

Edit/replace the text above if you want to include a schedule table.
See the contents of the _includes/custom_schedule.html file for an example of
how one of these schedule tables is constructed.

'tools/check' as well.
