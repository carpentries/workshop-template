# workshop-template

This repository is [Software Carpentry][swc-site] and [Data Carpentry][dc-site]'s
template for creating websites for workshops.

1.  Please *do not fork this repository directly on GitHub.*
    Instead, please use GitHub's importer following the instructions [below](#creating-a-repository)
    to create a website repository for your workshop.

2.  Please *do your work in your repository's `gh-pages` branch*,
    since that is what is
    [automatically published as a website by GitHub][github-project-pages].

3.  Once you are done,
    please **send your repository's URL to the [Software Carpentry administrator][contact]**.
    We build the list of workshops on our websites from the data included in your `index.html` page.
    We can only do that if you [customize][customization] that page correctly
    *and* send us a link to your workshop website.

4.  Please also read
    [the notes on customizing your website][customization] and the [FAQ][faq].
    If you're interested in knowing more about why we do things the way we do,
    please check out the [design notes][design].

5.  If you are teaching Git,
    please [create a separate repository](#setting-up-a-separate-repository-for-learners)
    for your learners to practice in.

6.  If you run into problems,
    or have ideas about how to make this process simpler,
    please [get in touch](#getting-and-giving-help).

## Creating a Repository

1.  Log in to GitHub.
    (If you do not have an account, you can quickly create one for free.)

2.  Go to [GitHub's importer][importer].

3.  Paste the url from the table below based on the language that you are interested.

    | Language   | ISO 639-1 | url                                                    |
    | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
    | English    | en-US     | https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template       |
    | Portuguese | pt-BR     | https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template-pt-br |

4.  Select the owner for your new repository.
    (This will probably be you, but may instead be an organization you belong to.)

5.  Choose a name for your workshop website repository.
    This name should have the form `YYYY-MM-DD-site`,
    e.g., `2015-07-01-miskatonic`,
    where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the start date of the workshop.

6.  Make sure the repository is public.

7.  At this point, you should have a page like this:

    ![](fig/using-github-import.png?raw=true)

    You can now click "Begin Import".
    When the process is done,
    you can click "Continue to repository" to visit your newly-created repository.

**Note:**
some people have had intermittent errors during the import process,
possibly because of the network timing out.
If you experience a problem, please re-try;
if the problem persists,
please [get in touch](#getting-and-giving-help).

## Customizing Your Website

1.  Go into your newly-created repository,
    which will be at `https://github.com/your_username/YYYY-MM-DD-site`.
    For example,
    if your username is `gvwilson`,
    the repository's URL will be `https://github.com/gvwilson/2015-07-01-miskatonic`.

2.  Edit the header of `index.html` to customize the list of instructors,
    workshop venue, etc. 
    You can do this in the browser by clicking on it in the file view on GitHub
    and then selecting the pencil icon in the menu bar:

    ![](fig/edit-index-file-menu-bar.png?raw=true)
    
    Editing hints are embedded in `index.html`,
    and full instructions are in [the customization instructions][customization].

3.  Alternatively, you can clone the repository to your desktop,
    edit `index.html` there,
    and push your changes back to the repository.

    ~~~
    git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/your_username/YYYY-MM-DD-site
    ~~~

    You should specify `-b gh-pages` because the imported repository doesn't have a `master` branch.

    **Note:** please do all of your work in your repository's `gh-pages` branch,
    since [GitHub automatically publishes that as a website][github-project-pages].

4.  The URL for your website is determined automatically based on the URL for your repository:
    if your repository is at `https://github.com/your_username/YYYY-MM-DD-site`,
    its GitHub Pages website is at `http://your_username.github.io/YYYY-MM-DD-site`.
    You must therefore edit the configuration values in `_config.yml` so that:

    1.  `carpentry` is either "dc" (for Data Carpentry) or "swc" (for Software Carpentry).
        This determines which logos are loaded.

    2.  `repo` is the name of your GitHub repository,
        e.g., `https://github.com/gvwilson/2015-07-01-miskatonic`.

    3.  `root` is the unique identifier of your workshop *with the leading '/'*,
        e.g., `/2015-07-01-miskatonic`.

    4.  `email` is the contact email address for your workshop,
        e.g., `gvwilson@miskatonic.edu`.

5.  When you are done editing,
    go to the GitHub Pages URL for your workshop and preview your changes.
    In the example above, this is `https://gvwilson.github.io/2015-07-01-miskatonic`.

**Note:** this template automatically creates some files and
directories that most workshops do not need, but which provide a
standard place to put extra content if desired.  See the [design
notes][design] for more information about these.

Further instructions are available in [_extras/customization.md][customization].
This [FAQ][faq] includes a few extra tips (additions are always welcome)
and these notes on [the background and design][design] of this template may help as well.

## Checking Your Changes

The following steps are only necessary if you want to preview your website locally on your computer.

1.  Install the software [described below](#installing-software).
    This may require some work,
    so feel free to preview by pushing to the website.

2.  Run the command:

    ~~~
    $ jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml
    ~~~

    and go to <http://0.0.0.0:4000> to preview your site.
    You can also run this command by typing `make serve`
    (assuming you have Make installed).

    **Note:** the command above uses the values from `_config.yml`,
    then overrides some of them with `_config_dev.yml`
    so that local files (including CSS style files) will load properly.
    Simply running `jekyll serve` will *not* load local files,
    so styles and icons may not display properly if you do this.

3.  Run the command `python bin/workshop_check.py index.html`
    to check for a few common errors in your workshop's home page.
    (You must have Python 3 installed to do this.)
    If you have Make installed,
    you can also run this command by typing `make workshop-check`.

## Installing Software

If you want to set up Jekyll
so that you can preview changes on your own machine before pushing them to GitHub,
you must install the software described below.
(Note: Julian Thilo has written instructions for
[installing Jekyll on Windows][jekyll-windows].)

1.  **Ruby**.
    This is included with Linux and Mac OS X;
    the simplest option on Windows is to use [RubyInstaller][ruby-installer].
    You can test your installation by running `ruby --version`.
    For more information,
    see [the Ruby installation guidelines][ruby-install-guide].

2.  **[RubyGems][rubygems]**
    (the package manager for Ruby).
    You can test your installation by running `gem --version`.

3.  **[Jekyll][jekyll]**.
    You can install this by running `gem install jekyll`.

If you want to run `bin/workshop_check.py` (which is invoked by `make workshop-check`)
to check for common errors in your workshop's home page,
you must have Python 3 installed.
You will also need the [PyYAML][pyyaml] module.

## Setting Up a Separate Repository for Learners

If you are teaching Git,
you should create a separate repository for learners to use in that lesson.
You should not have them use the workshop website repository because:

*   your workshop website repository contains many files
    that most learners don't need to see during the lesson,
    and

*   you probably don't want to accidentally merge
    a damaging pull request from a novice Git user
    into your workshop's website while you are using it to teach.

You can call this repository whatever you like,
and add whatever content you need to it.

## Getting and Giving Help
