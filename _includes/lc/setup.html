  <h3>Spreadsheet Software</h3>
  <p>
    To interact with spreadsheets, we can use <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a>, 
    <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/excel">Microsoft Excel</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.gnumeric.org">Gnumeric</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>, 
    or other programs. 
    Commands may differ a bit between programs, but general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets is the same.
