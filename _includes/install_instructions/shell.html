          The default shell in some versions of macOS is Bash, and
	  Bash is available in all versions, so no need to install anything.
	  You access Bash from the Terminal (found in
	  <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).
          See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a>
          for an example on how to open the Terminal.
          You may want to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
            To see if your default shell is Bash type <code>echo $SHELL</code>
            in Terminal and press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key. If the message
            printed does not end with '/bash' then your default is something
            else and you can run Bash by typing <code>bash</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to change your default shell, see <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208050" rel="noopener">
          this Apple Support article</a> and follow the instructions on "How to change your default shell".

          The default shell is usually Bash and there is usually no need to
          install anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see if your default shell is Bash type <code>echo $SHELL</code> in
          a terminal and press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. If the message printed
          does not end with '/bash' then your default is something else and you
          can run Bash by typing <code>bash</code>.
