  <h3>OpenRefine</h3>
  <p>
    For this lesson you will need <em>OpenRefine</em> and a
    web browser. <em>Note:</em> this is a Java program that runs on your machine (not in the cloud).
    It runs inside a web browser, but no web connection is needed.

        Check that you have either the Firefox or the Chrome browser installed and set as your default browser.
        <strong>OpenRefine runs in your default browser.</strong>
        It will not run correctly in Internet Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>Download software from <a href="http://openrefine.org/">http://openrefine.org/</a></p>
      <p>Create a new directory called OpenRefine.</p>
      <p>Unzip the downloaded file into the OpenRefine directory by right-clicking and selecting "Extract ...". </p>
      <p>Go to your newly created OpenRefine directory.</p>
      <p>Launch OpenRefine by clicking <code>google-refine.exe</code> (this will launch a command prompt window, but you can ignore that - just wait for OpenRefine to open in the browser).
      <p>If you are using a different browser, or if OpenRefine does not automatically open for you, point your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3333/">http://127.0.0.1:3333/</a> or <a href="http://localhost:3333">http://localhost:3333</a> to use the program.</p>
